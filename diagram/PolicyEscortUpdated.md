Policy escorts shared between the Fleet Management System (FMS) and the Autonomous Haulage System (AHS) shall be treated as immutable and as such, update calls are not supported.

To update a policy escort, the Fleet Management System (FMS) shall delete the existing policy escort, and create a new policy escort with the new updated information.
